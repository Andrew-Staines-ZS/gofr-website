## Customizing

You can start customizing this template by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

## Global search

This template includes a global search that's powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `âŒ˜K` shortcut.

The search feature requires no configuration, and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index.
You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/markdoc/search.mjs` file.
